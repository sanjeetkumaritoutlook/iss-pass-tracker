# ----------------------
# Additional notes (in this canvas only):
# 1) CHANGE the project name in pyproject.toml to a unique package name before publishing.
# 2) Replace author metadata and repository URLs.
# 3) Consider adding `requests` to install_requires in setup.cfg or project.dependencies if you want automatic install.
#    For now requests is a runtime import; if you want to ensure it's installed:
#
#    [project]
#    dependencies = ["requests>=2.0"]
#
# 4) Use TestPyPI first:
#    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
#    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ iss-pass-tracker
#
# 5) If you'd like, I can:
#    - produce the wheel and sdist here and give you download links,
#    - or modify the package to use N2YO with an API key and optional elevation/direction.
