python -m build
# Test upload (recommended):

# Real upload:
# twine upload dist/*
```

## Quick usage
```python
from iss_pass_tracker import get_passes

# Hyderabad coordinates
passes = get_passes(lat=17.385044, lon=78.486671, n=5)
for p in passes:
    print(p.risetime.isoformat(), 'duration', p.duration)
```
